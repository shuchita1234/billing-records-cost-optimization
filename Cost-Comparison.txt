Parameter	        Value
Average record size	300 KB
Total records	        2,000,000
Total data volume	~572 GB (300 KB × 2M = 600 GB,             actual size considering overhead = ~572 GB)
Eligible for archive	Records older than 3 months (~75%)
Cold archive target	1,500,000 records ≈ 430 GB

Azure Cosmos DB Cost (Analytical Store Mode) – Before Archival

Assume:

You're using provisioned throughput with manual RU/s (~10,000 RU/s for a moderately read-heavy app).

You pay for both storage and throughput.


 ----Cosmos DB Storage Cost
Metric	               Value
Storage in GB	       600 GB
Cost per GB	       $0.25/month
Monthly Storage Cost    Cosmos DB RU Cost (Provisioned Throughput)
Let’s assume:

You use ~10,000 RU/s, which costs ≈ $0.008/hour per RU/s

Metric	                Value
Cost for 10,000 RU/s	$0.008 × 10,000
Hourly cost	        $80
Monthly (730 hrs)	        $58,400
This is total RU/s cost; archival reduces the required RU/s by offloading old data reads.$143.00

----------------------------------------------------
After Archival to Azure Cold (Online Access Tier)
--We'll push ~430 GB (75% of 572 GB) to Azure Blob Cold (Online) storage.

Blob Storage Cost (Cool Tier)
Metric	Value
Data size	430 GB
Storage Cost (Cool Tier)	$0.01–$0.02 per GB/month
Monthly Blob Cost (cool)	~$6.45
 Blob Access Cost
Assume 1% access rate (occasional retrievals).

Reads in cool tier ≈ $0.01 per 10,000 operations

Assume 20K reads/month = $0.02

Monthly Cost Comparison
Component	Cosmos DB Only	Cosmos + Blob (Optimized)
Cosmos DB Storage (572 GB)	$143.00	$35.75 (25% data)
Cosmos DB RU/s (10K)	$58,400.00	$14,600.00 (assume 75% load reduction)
Blob Storage (Cool, 430 GB)	N/A	$6.45
Blob Read Ops (20K/month)	N/A	$0.02
Total Monthly	~$58,543.00	~$14,642.22
Monthly Cost Savings
Savings = $58,543 - $14,642.22 ≈ $43,900+ per month

 Annual Savings: ≈ $527,000+

 i.e., >75% cost reduction	From ~$58K/month to ~$14K/month
